SUQA is a new opensource peer to peer digital currency that gives the investors 5% apr interest from term deposits even if the wallet is offline. It is based on an improved code of the secure and widely used Bitcoin Blockchain with a brand new advanced memory intensive X22i POW algo which is completely ASIC, FPGA and Quantum Resistant.

SUQA is a name of an ancient coin from Nepal that has been used for thousands of years and it also means 'to wait'(Time-Lock) in Somali language.

Following are some of the problems which SUQA currency addresses:

1. Lack of recognition and adaptation of blockchain and digital payments. 
2. Lack of coins which are being used in real life ecosystems. 
3. Lack of Trust in cryptocurrency world. 
4. Centralization threat from ASIC and FPGA companies.
5. Quantum Attack threat from future Quantum Computers.
6. Need for a new complex, secure, ASIC and FPGA resistant, memory optimized, post quantum algorithm for constant dynamic decentralization.


SUQA Features:

1. Fast:
Fastest POW Coin: 533 Transactions per second. 75 times more scalable than Bitcoin.

2. Rewarding:
Investors can earn 5% apr interest from term deposits even if the wallet is offline. First 3 months monthly term deposit apr will be 25% apr to encourage early adopters and investors.  

3. Almost No Transaction Fees
SUQA allows you to make instant payments with incredibly low fees for each transaction. Using blockchain technology, transactions are performed directly between two digital wallets.

4. Protection
To ensure the safety of the SUQA ecosystem, SUQA has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses. More importantly ASIC, FPGA and Quantum Attack protection make SUQA a very secure and future-proof digital currency. 
 
5. Transparency
SUQA is a free open source project that is built by expert blockchain developers and supported by a rapidly growing community of blockchain enthusiasts that stretches around the globe. 

SUQA Use Cases:

SUQA currency can be used in any digital transaction where other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is being used. The major use of SUQA currency in a real world ecosystem is SUQA Foundation where no other cryptocurrency except SUQA can be used. 

Suqa Foundation is a Decentralized Autonomous Philanthropist Organization that rewards everyone inside its ecosystem generously, securely and transparently without fees, to foster the growth of the Blockchain.

There will be 3 microsites of SUQA Foundation Platform where the SUQA currency can be utilized. The platform will consist of Cryptolancers(anyone related to crypto), Blockchain Startup Companies and Charities.

Technical Details:

X22i-Algo
X22i is the newest most complex, advanced, quantum resistant algorithm for the millions of gpu miners and it is also one of the most power efficient hash algorithms. “I” stands for the 22 algorithms intelligence and it is not just another clone or a copy cat of another algo but instead it has too much optimization potential for all the CUDA and OPENCL Developers because of the added complex Post Quantum algo SWIFFTX.
New PoW algorithm providing the following advantages:
- Adding a quantum resistant part in the algo chain (SWIFFTX)
- Rising the memory requirements four times, not a problem for CPU and GPU but much harder for FPGA and ASIC
- Much longer algo chain: 22 algorithms create the need for a lot of chip space to implement the whole chain, very cost un-effective for FPGAS and ASICS.
- We will require a hard fork every 6 months to add a new ASIC and FPGA resistant algo to guarantee decentralization.

Time-Lock Deposit
Please go to file, receiving adress and copy the wallet address from there.
Please choose deposit from the top and paste the adress to where it says deposit adress. Please choose the amount and click on how long  you want to time-lock your SUQA for, choose for up to 4 weeks and up to 25% apr for the first 3 months for early adapters.After 3 months 1 month time-locked term deposit will be 5% apr.
Click on EARN. Click on YES and YES. You should see on  the amount you put on hold and how much you will receive on the overview screen. Once it is time-locked it will not be possible to unlock it until the chosen time.

SUQA Mac Wallet is released. https://github.com/SUQAORG/SUQA-CORE/releases

https://coinguides.org/solo-mining-guide/

Solo mining example:

ccminer -a x22i -s 5 --no-longpoll --coinbase-addr=<your_receiving_address> -o http://localhost:20971/ -u <your_wallet_rpc_username> -p <your_wallet_rpc_password>

Pool mining example :

ccminer -a x22i -o stratum+tcp://preferredpool:port-u Weblogin.WorkerName -p WorkerPassword

Sample OC settings: PL 65, Core +100, memory + 300 (for all nvidia cards)

Memory clock matters, play with it!

If you get errors when starting the miner, set the wallet language to english
