L33T is a new opensource peer to peer Gaming Coin that gives the investors 5% apr interest from term deposits even if the wallet is offline. It is based on an improved code of the secure and widely used Bitcoin Blockchain with a brand new advanced memory intensive X22i POW algo which is completely ASIC, FPGA and Quantum Resistant.

Meaning of "L33T"
The term L33T In gaming a term to describe one with a great deal of skill, or to describe incredibly advanced technology. One who is l33t is the opposite of being a noob. L33tness is relative but usually comes with experience and skill (or upgraded hardware for better gaming speed and performance).

Following are some of the problems which L33T Coin addresses:

1. Lack of earning real coin for gaming, the gamer is in control here.
2. Earn staking on coins you earned by gaming (not tokens you can only use in a game) trade L33T on an exchange.
2. Lack of Trust in cryptocurrency world.
3. Centralization threat from ASIC and FPGA companies.
4. Quantum Attack threat from future Quantum Computers.
5. Need for a new complex, secure, ASIC and FPGA resistant, memory optimized, post quantum algorithm for constant dynamic decentralization.


L33T Features:

1. Fast:
533 Transactions per second. 75 times more scalable than Bitcoin.

2. Rewarding:
Investors and Gamers can earn 5% apr interest from term deposits even if the wallet is offline. First 3 months monthly term deposit apr will be 25% apr to encourage early adopters and investors. 

3. Almost No Transaction Fees
L33T allows you to make instant payments with incredibly low fees for each transaction. Using blockchain technology, transactions are performed directly between two digital wallets.

4. Protection
To ensure the safety of the L33T ecosystem, L33T has implemented full replay protection and unique wallet addresses. More importantly ASIC, FPGA and Quantum Attack protection make L33T a very secure and future-proof Gaming Coin. 
 
5. Transparency
L33T is a free open source project that is built by expert blockchain developers and supported by a rapidly growing community of blockchain enthusiasts that stretches around the globe. 

L33T Use Cases:

L33T Coin can be used in the same way other crypto coins are being used today. The major use of L33T Coin in a real world ecosystem is L33T establishes a portal for gamers to receive tangible rewards. 

L33T Coin is a Decentralized cryptocurrency that rewards everyone inside its ecosystem generously, securely and transparently without fees, to foster the growth of the Blockchain.

Technical Details:

X22i-Algo
X22i is the newest most complex, advanced, quantum resistant algorithm for the millions of gpu miners and it is also one of the most power efficient hash algorithms. “I” stands for the 22 algorithms intelligence and it is not just another clone or a copy cat of another algo but instead it has too much optimization potential for all the CUDA and OPENCL Developers because of the added complex Post Quantum algo SWIFFTX.
New PoW algorithm providing the following advantages:
- Adding a quantum resistant part in the algo chain (SWIFFTX)
- Rising the memory requirements four times, not a problem for CPU and GPU but much harder for FPGA and ASIC
- Much longer algo chain: 22 algorithms create the need for a lot of chip space to implement the whole chain, very cost un-effective for FPGAS and ASICS.
- We will require a hard fork every 6 months to add a new ASIC and FPGA resistant algo to guarantee decentralization.

Time-Lock Deposit
Please go to file, receiving adress and copy the wallet address from there.
Please choose deposit from the top and paste the adress to where it says deposit adress. Please choose the amount and click on how long  you want to time-lock your L33T for, choose for up to 4 weeks and up to 25% apr for the first 3 months for early adapters.After 3 months 1 month time-locked term deposit will be 5% apr.
Click on EARN. Click on YES and YES. You should see on  the amount you put on hold and how much you will receive on the overview screen. Once it is time-locked it will not be possible to unlock it until the chosen time.
